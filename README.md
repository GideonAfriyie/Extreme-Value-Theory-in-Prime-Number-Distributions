# prime-number-analysis
Exploring the structure and growth of prime numbers through gaps, log behavior, and classical conjectures

## Overview
This project investigates statistical and visual trends in the first 1,000 prime numbers. It includes gap analysis, conjecture comparisons, and logarithmic visualizations.
