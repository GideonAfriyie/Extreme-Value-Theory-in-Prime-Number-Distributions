# Extreme Value Theory Analysis of Prime Gap Distributions: Statistical Validation of Cramér’s Conjecture and Heavy-Tailed Behavior: 
Prime Gap Patterns — A Statistical and Computational Study

### 📌 Overview

This project investigates prime number gaps in the first 1,000,000 primes. Inspired by my abstract math course and personal curiosity, I used Python and Excel to explore statistical trends, verify conjectures, and visualize key number theory concepts.

### 📊 Highlights

- Analyzed prime gaps (2–154)
- Mode = 6 (146,518 occurrences)
- 86,027 twin primes (gap = 2)
- Tested Cramér’s Conjecture ($\log^2(p)$)
- Q-Q plot for normality check
- Empirical PDF and CDF using Seaborn
- Gap % 6 analysis (0 mod 6 dominated)
- All visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn
